Outlier filtering:
- kmeans
- better half

Experimental investigation: (log book)
- adding noise to particle cloud
- visualizing sensor model function etc `self.sensor_model.predict(obs_range, map_range)` 
  by plotting a graph of probabilities for various observation and prediction ranges
- measuring overall location error over time
- compare performance with AMCL implementation

Document:
- design choices
- result of experimental analysis

Additional features:
- should be able to deal with "kidnapped robot"

Optional task:
- adaptive MCL (vary number of particles)
- kalman filter-based localization
